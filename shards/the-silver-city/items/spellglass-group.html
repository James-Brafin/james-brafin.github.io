					<b>Spellglass</b> is a crafting material and spellcasting focus created in the Silver City. It is the primary export of many Mobs, and is used in a wide variety of
					industrial and domestic applications. While typically found used in magical items, wasted glass can often be found sold in Spellglass Shards, which mantain some minor properties.
				</p>

				<h3 id="description"> Description </h3>
				<p> 
					Spellglass is similar in appearance to stained glass, with flecks of material inside that appear to make it glow slightly in the dark. The color of Spellglass depends
					largely on the impurites introduced to induce the particular magical quantities of the glass. Raw Spellglass is typically sold in small beads, though once used, any excess is often
					discarded in irregular chunks roughly the size of a fist. While molten, this glass glows with matching color, giving off distinctly magical light.
					
					When presented with a magical detection field, Spellglass glows brightly in the color of the glass, making it easily identifiable. This makes it a popular tool for
					hiding other, more subtle magical signatures.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="production"> Production </h3>
				<p> 
					Spellglass is produced by exposing normal glass to the Mists while molten, and then adding magical reagents to define the attunement of the glass. The precise methods of this
					depend on the glass foundries doing production; while some foundries purchase and use land near the edge of the City, others import bottled Mists from the city edge and infuse it into
					their furnaces, with <a href="" class="broken", class="navLink"> varying levels of success.</a> Because of the delicacy of this process, Spellglass is generally made in smaller quantities,
					though the sheer number of foundries (which are often controlled in swaths by Mobs) helps to provide for growing demands. While some glass is widely availiable and regularly produced,
					many forms of Spellglass are made only on demand, making some varieties increasingly rare and prized by collectors and those seeking to duplicate particularly complex batches.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="usage"> Usage </h3>
				<p> 
					Spellglass is primarily used in the creation of a variety of magical creations. Many of these are false gemstones that are set into jewelry, but skilled glassblowers
					have been known to make glass into prized and deadly weapons. Objects might also be inset with this glass in order to infuse it with various magical properties.
					While some experimentation has been done to create threads and alloys of this material for various purposes, success in this regard has been unfortunateley limited
					by fragility and costs.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Extra pieces of glass are often sold as Spellglass Shards, which can be socketed into weapons or used to channel magical energy in a limited fashion.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Spellglass has taken up a variety of uses in industrial purposes. Notably, Spellglass is used to craft the arcana cores used in 
					<a href="../lore/runic-arrays.html">Runic Arrays</a>. However, it is commonly used in many applications that require constant, distinctly magical power, such as furnaces, coolers,
					and other manufacturing processes. Some forms of Spellglass have been used in research settings to power sensitive devices as well.
				</p>
				<p> 
					In the home, Spellglass can most commonly be found in electrical wires and components, replaceing the costly trace metals that are regluated much more heavily by many Mobs
					in the City. It is also commonly used to maintain refrigeration units, power grow lights for in-home food growth, and many other applications.

				<h3 id="mechanics"> Mechanics </h3>
				<p>
					Depending on its properties, Spellglass has a variety of effects (detailed on specific pages). More general mechanical information is maintained here.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Spellglass Shards are magical items that can be used as a Socket in an appropriate weapon, or as an item for physical magical effects. They come in a few tiers,
					depending on their post-production quality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clouded Spell Shards are the weakest of the shards, caused by impurities in the creation of the glass. They have two charges, which they regain at dawn. 
					Spells using this Shard have a +5 attack bonus and a Spell DC of 17.
				</p>
				<p>
					Opaque Spell Shards lack resonance, but have lasting power. They have three charges, which they regain at dawn. 
					Spells using this Shard have a +5 attack bonus and a Spell DC of 17.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cracked Spell Shards are damaged and brittle examples of Clear Spell Shards, making them easier to find than their more stable
					counterparts. They have two charges, which they regain at dawn. 
					Spells using this Shard have a +10 attack bonus and a Spell DC of 23. When used, make a flat DC 5 check.  
					On a failure, the Spell Shard shatters into fragments and becomes useless.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clear Spell Shards pass light nicely, and could be refined into small gemstones to use in magical items given enough time and care.
					They have two charges, which they regain at dawn. Spells using this Shard have a +10 attack bonus and a Spell DC of 23.
				</p>
				<p>
					Resonant Spell Shards are rare examples of their specimen, and are sought after by collectors. They have two charges, which they regain at dawn.
					Spells using this Shard have a +15 attack bonus and a Spell DC of 28.
				</p>
