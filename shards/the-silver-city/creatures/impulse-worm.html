					<i>Ceratonies accimperius</i>, common name Impulse Worm is a parasitic worm native to the moist upper regions of the Undercity. 
					This creature has several subspecies, which vary only in size and relative strength -- the most common species, <i>Ceratonies accimperius major,</i>
					is the species that commonly afflicts medium-sized creatures.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Appearance"> Appearance </h3>
				<p> 
					<i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> appears to be a network of long, fiber-like tentacles that are capable of locomotion. Their coloration varies from grey to pale pinks. 
					While appearing to be one creature, <i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> is in fact a collection of organisms and bears a close resemblance to  
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge"> sea sponges </a> in this regard.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hosts of <i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> can be identified by small markings around the nose, mouth, and eyes, where infection occurs. Hosts also often behave erratically and
					display signs of distress, despite having no injuries and no danger being present.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Abilities"> Abilities </h3>
				<p> 
					<i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> are capable of limited locomotion on their own, typically using hosts to move and capture prey. They are capable of regeneration, and reproduce asexually, 
					intentionally splitting themselves to bud into two genetically identical offspring. <i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> are capable of generating electrical shocks, which they use to stun
					and capture their prey. They are also able to stretch and extend their feeling appendages a great distance, typically about 10 feet.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Behavior"> Behavior </h3>
				<p> 
					<i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> are ambush predators, typically dwelling in moist areas like sewers and near-surface caves. When potential prey passes near by, 
					they grab and burrow into the prey's spine and nervous system, consuming and replacing it. The <i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> then utilizes the remaining carcass 
					to travel and locate additional prey, if necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					When threatened, <i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> will defend itself by attacking predators with electric shocks and slashing it with its appendages, which is generally enough to deter
					a would-be attacker. While not physically harmed by sunlight, they do seem to be sensitive to sun and will avoid it when possible, even while in a host. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> have been known to mimic behaviors and sounds made by their host, despite hosts having no measurable consiousness. It is believed that this process
					is due to remnant neural impulses caused from consumption of the central nervous system. There is no evidence to suggest that <i>Ceratonies accimperius</i> feels pain, despite
					claims to the contrary by hosts.
