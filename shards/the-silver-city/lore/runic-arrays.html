					<b> Runic Arrays </b> are magical constructions that utilize runic circles to calculate on and display data. While useful and not terribly expensive, 
					these devices are large and difficult to move, bearing resembleance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum-tube_computer"> vacuum-tube computers </a>. 
					They are commonly used for industrial or scientific purposes, being too large to fit in most households.
				</p>

				<h3 id="construction"> Construction </h3>
				<p> 
					Runic Arrays are formed from stone or metal sheets etched with a series of runes and attached to a Arcana Core. When provided with inputs, these cores run arcane
					energy through these runes to run calculations and provide a result onto sheets of glass enchanted with illusory magic. While this primarily is used for advanced math and 
					running complex simulations, these devices can be augmented either by swapping these sheets or by inserting Runic Array Drives, which contains additional runes 
					that may provide additional functions or data. Some arrays are capable of writing to these drives as well, allowing for data storage and access at a later date.
					
					Most Runic Arrays are large devices, ranging from the size of several bookshelves to filling an entire room depending on complexity and function. 
					Most Arrays weigh hundreds of pounds, and their components tend to be fragile -- thin stone easily breaks, and metal can bend and damage the runes. This makes moving established
					Arrays difficult, though it is possible with enough time and care. Arcana Cores are also fragile, and tend to need regular maintenance and replacement to function.
					
					<h4>Runic Array Drives</h4>
					Runic Array Drives (RADrs) are small devices the size of a toaster. They contain multiple sheets of runes written on light metals and are used to augment Runic Arrays in a modular manner.
					Most arrays contain particular simulations, but others can be programmed to store information as well.

				<h3 id="development"> Development </h3>
				<p> 
					Runic Arrays have been conceptualized for several hundred years, though only recent improvements in runecarving have allowed for their existence on a practical scale. 
					The first designs for these devices were created in 357 AC, but while the magic behind them was sound, the size of the runes needed to achieve this required more fine
					detail work than was possible at the time. As carving techniques advanced, the possibility of such a device existing increased, and in 765 AC the first Runic Array was constructed.
					At the time, it took up several rooms and was only capable of simple calculations. Over the past century, their functionality has increased as carving techniques have improved, though
					size and weight remains a limiting factor.
				</p> 
				<p> 
					More recent innovations include the improvement of the glass screens that are now used to control the arrays, as well as a more developed runic language allowing for more complex
					and detailed functionality. The development of Light-Piercing equipment in the past decade has also allowed for Arrays to perform etching operations, allowing them to write to 
					smaller sheets to create and store data on RADrs.
				</p>

				<h3 id="usage"> Usage </h3>
				<p> 
					Because of their versatility in programming, Runic Arrays have seen increased usage in a number of areas, from industrial to scientific.
				</p>
				<h4>Industrial<h4>
				<p>
					Runic Arrays can be programmed to perform simple tasks by attaching them to magically-enhanced machinery. While the technology remains primitive and limited.
					these devices can be used to duplicate print quickly, monitor objects and send alerts, and run simple machinery, to name a few functions. This makes them
					popular for use in mass-production settings, though size limits their use to only the largest-scale operations.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Research<h4>
				<p>
					In larger research intitutions, Runic Arrays are commonly used to perform complex calculations or model real-world problems. Cutting-edge advancements have allowed 
					illusory magics to project three-dimensional, interactable images into space, which allows for multiple angles and real-time interaction and exploration. While these 
					images remain fairly small, they provide immense value to scientists working on complex or difficult-to-visualize problems. While many computers are too large for personal
					use, and remain in centers of learning and development, some researchers have begun using smaller-scale private arrays for less complex calculations.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Data Storage<h4>
				<p>
					With the advent of RADr writing technology, many Arrays are being outfitted with devices that allow them to read and store data for later use, either on internal hardware
					or external drives. This has allowed for important data to be stored securely on Arrays, in what is significantly smaller space. With modern techniques, a RADr is capable of 
					storing around 200-300 pages worth of documentation in a quarter of the volume. This has led to improved data compression and transport, as well as increased security.
