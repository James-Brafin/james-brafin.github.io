					The Polyx Institute of Experimental Biomancy is a smaller and acclaimed magical college dedicated to the study of bio-magical and bio-mechanical engineering. 
					Located in Lethus Polyx, this small campus is the focal point of the local community, 
					providing much of the economic value and physical strength to the district. 
					The campus itself takes up about 10 blocks of small (for the city) high-rise structures, which includes lodging, amenities, classrooms, 
					laboratories, and even some “greenspace” in designated recreational greenhouses. While small (boasting a population of only about 2,500 students), 
					the school is well-known for its strong curriculums and quality of life, 
					and is supported by grants from both individuals and several mobs (including Osiris LTD, among others). The school specializes in genetic experimentation, 
					medical biomancy, and bio-mechanical applications.
