					<b>The Steel Barons</b> provide a major source of raw materials to the city through a network of mining camps, refineries, and metal factories, 
					all run on hellish heat. While many lower-level members of the Barons, as well as their employees, are humanoid, the Mob itself is composed of demons, 
					devils, and those with fiendish heritage. These taskmasters keep their furnaces alive by brokering deals with their employees that are all to the Mob’s benefit, 
					creating workers for life and even through death. And if they can’t make a deal, the Barons are just as willing to enslave and torture humanoids to bend them to their will, 
					maintaining camps and factory towns through sheer brutality. Ruthless, dangerous, and willing to kill to keep their turf, t
					he Barons have many enemies but have kept their share of the metals market for decades, an impressive feat for any Mob in the city.

				<h3 id="StructureandHistory"> Structure and History </h3>
				<p> 
					Pockets in the Undercity have been well-documented to contain entrances into both the Abyss and Hell, 
					though these mouths are fickle and rarely stay open for more than a few days. Because of this, 
					there are many Mobs that boast at least some fiendish heritage or membership. However, the Barons are one of the most prolific in this regard. 
					Founded by a Furnace-Tender who left the Nine Hells in the decade of 840 AC (After Calamity), 
					the Barons quickly rose to prominence thanks to the quality and low price of their metals. 
					The resulting Mob has seen plenty of competition, but nothing burns hotter than hellfire, and their conscripted workforce keeps prices low and resources flowing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like many larger Mobs, the majority of the people employed by the Steel Barons aren’t considered proper Mob members. 
					Rather, the Mob is composed of Demons, Devils, and those of Fiendish heritage, who work to oversee the factories, mining camps, 
					and refineries that make up the majority of Baron holdings. These networks are vast, and while most sites have middle managers, 
					upper-level Mob members might oversee the function of hundreds of different sites. As the Barons have expanded, 
					this has bogged down the function of their leaders, which depending on who you ask might be a good or bad thing. For the devils, 
					they revel in the opportunities to take control of more people and expand their holdings over the City, whereas the demon factions 
					dislike the tedium and would prefer a more active and direct role in running the factories.
				</p>
				<p>
					In recent years, the Barons’ growing territory and bureaucratic tendencies has led them to hire out other Mobs and 
					Mercs to do their dirty work for them, which has resulted in a lot of collaboration and helped to keep competition down. 
					While non-Mob members may dislike the Barons’ practices, there is no denying that Baron turf is generally safer and more 
					controlled than when other Mobs are in control, and so most people put up very little fight. Still, the Barons show signs of decay; 
					internal power struggles have caused halts in production, and rebellions from within Baron holdings have halted supply lines as well. 
					As with all Mobs, the Barons also face constant competitive pressure, though they have been able to negotiate and strong-arm their way 
					to handling that problem up until this point.
				</p>

				<h3 id="UrbanNiche"> Urban Niche </h3>
				<p> 
					The Steel Barons specialize in metal refinery and distribution, focusing their efforts on extracting and purifying ores from the Undercity. 
					This is a large task, and most Mob members oversee these processes rather than take part in the manual labor involved. 
					The Barons are also experts in creating contracts that benefit them and take advantage of unsuspecting hires, 
					locking them into long years of service. While the Barons don’t produce rarer metals and alloys, they provide high quantities of cheaper metals like steel 
					(from which they get the name) to fuel construction projects across the city.

				<h3 id="PeopleofNote"> People of Note </h3>
				<h4> Atrius Resthluk </h4>
				<p> 
					The Furnace-Tender devil who founded the Barons. In the Nine Hells, Furnace-Tenders are considered low-ranking devils, 
					but in the City, Atrius found he had a knack for tending the fires that could be used to melt down ores to create valuable metal. 
					As his empire grew, so did his power -- while not a full Pit Fiend by any means, Atrius is a dangerous individual who can wield great power if threatened.
				</p>
				
				<h4> Korkros </h4>
				<p> 
					Korkros the Kalavakus is a Slaver Demon who oversees the mining camps beneath the surface of the City. He is brutally skilled at this, 
					though his sprawling network of underlings helps to maintain his control over the mines. Of all the demons in the Barons, Korkros is the most patient, 
					though even he tires of his endless paperwork from time to time. However, his willingness to work with the devils of the Barons helps to keep the other demons in check.
				</p>
				
				<h4> Torgorath </h4>
				<p>	
					An elder Brimorak, Torgorath leads the ground forces of the Barons when needed to quash other Mobs who try 
					to stand in the Barons’ authority. Torgorath’s use has been limited of late, and they chafe at the inability to do some real carnage. 
					This frequently brings him into conflict with other members of the Barons.
				</p>
				
				<h4> Ogret </h4>
				<p> 
					This Ice Devil maintains the legal contracts that the Barons create with their employees and settles any disputes they might have. 
					He is skilled and tactical, but has a strong ego, and has more than once challenged Atrius’s authority. It has never gone well, 
					but Ogret is too valuable to the Mob to get rid of. Still, his challenges cause delays and bolster the demon factions that would see more destruction being done.
				</p>
				
				<h4> Yanthon </h4>
				<p> 
					This Bearded Devil is responsible for maintaining employees and the refineries they work on, a job she despises. The end result has been the degrade 
					of working conditions across the board in Baron workplaces, a fact that few point out because it is likely to get them killed. Even then, Yanthon 
					would like nothing more than to take over the Mob and run it in a way that she deems more fit.
				</p>

				<h3 id="ImportantResources"> Important Resources </h3>
				<p> 
					As one of the main metal refiners in the city, the Barons have ready access to most low-cost materials. While this is primarily steel, it also includes some low-grade
					magical metals, which can have a variety of benefits when worked. The Barons also have large swaths of workers, both living and dead, 
					that can be borrowed when a bit more manpower is needed. Their fiendish nature also allows them some limited magic, though the Divine Barrier significantly restricts this.
