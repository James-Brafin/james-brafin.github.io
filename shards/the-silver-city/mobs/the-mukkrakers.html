					<b>The Mukkrakers</b> are a small Mob of investigators, reporters, and espionage specailists who work to expose and bring down the more corrupt and destructive Mobs in the City. 
					They maintain a small pamphlet, <i>The Mukkraker's Herald,</i> which they spread and use to report on their discoveries. While not particularly powerful physcially, they are a thorn in the side
					of Mobs that would prefer their less-than pleasant activites come to public scrutiny. The Mukkrakers are also experts in information gathering and can be useful contacts for rumors and answers.
				</p>

				<h3 id="StructureandHistory"> Structure and History </h3>
				<p> 
					The Mukkrakers come and go from City history, having existed for at least the past 50 years. The initial Mob was born from a split with <i>The Harrower’s Herald</i> over 
					disagreements over the leniency of articles on larger Mobs. The Mukkrakers demanded more accountability and transparency, which <i>The Harrower’s Herald</i> writers feared would bring down the 
					wrath of the more dangerous Mobs. In response to this, The Mukkrakers broke off and begain printing their own, more radical <i>The Mukkraker's Herald.</i> While it did attract unwanted attention,
					the pamphlet was fairly successful, and has been noted for bringing about change and coups on multiple occasions throughout the years.
				</p>
				<p>
					These days, The Mukkrakers have stayed close to their original goal, though spread throughout the City has caused many of them to focus on more local, 
					District-wide problems. Districts with active members typically hold an independent cell of four to seven Mukkrakers, who maintain and operate a local press and copy of <i>The Mukkraker's Herald.</i>
					While there is no overarching leadership or formal connection of cells, Mukkrakers can recognize each other by their motto or small pins with their Mob symbol, attached to the inside of coats or other
					loose-fitting clothing. Membership is extremely selective, due to the dangerous nature of their work, and often cells may maintain dozens of safehouses that they move between periodically, with presses that 
					can be taken down, transported, and reassembled in the space of a few hours. Unlike many other news orginizations, The Mukkrakers tend to favor physcial, mechanical presses over those run on Runic Arrays, 
					which can be harder to maintain and move, and are often more expensive to upkeep as well.
				</p>

				<h3 id="UrbanNiche"> Urban Niche </h3>
				<p> 
					Because of their particular line of work, The Mukkrakers are mostly popular among revolutionaries, Mercs, and city anarchists. They rarely interact favorably with larger and 
					more destructive mobs, who often see them as a nuisance at best and a liability at worst. Smaller Mobs, however, may find <i>The Mukkraker's Herald</i> invaluable for gathering information
					on their larger rivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					While The Mukkrakers don't typically engage in direct document trade, they do often carry a lot of information that others might find handy, and are known to connect citizens in need
					to helpful Mercs or capable small-time Mobs as needed. They also may be willing to sell hot information to people they deem trustworthy ahead of their next issue of the <i>Herald.</i>

				<p> 
					The Mukkrakers have access to a number of custom printing presses that allow them to produce and publish <i>The Mukkraker's Herald.</i> 
					This can be useful if information needs to be dissiminated in a hurry. They also maintain (and can temporarily outfit) presses to print Scrolls, 
					as long as they have access to the proper magic and materials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Great investigative abilites often leads The Mukkrakers to unusual opportunities. <i>The Mukkraker's Herald</i> often prints advertisements for Mercs for odd jobs around the local District.
					Players with good relationships with a Mukkraker cell might recieve information about better jobs, or be able to approach the cell if looking for available opportunites.
