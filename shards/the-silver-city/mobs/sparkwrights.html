					<b> Sparkwright, LTD. </b> is a small research and development company and Mob that operates out of their own building in Blackwreth Way. While small, 
					their membership supports and invests in small-time inventors and alchemists who are working on advancements in their specialized fields. While their goals are 
					altruistic, the Sparkwrights sometimes find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion when an experiment goes haywire, and they have to quickly make amends.

				<h3 id="StructureandHistory"> Structure and History </h3>
				<p> 
					Sparkwright LTD. was founded in 863 AC by Alexus Thraw, an a wealthy orc who, along with a few friends, wished to invest more heavily in protective equipment development
					in the City. Their success lead to further investments and the formation of their own investment core, which quickly grew to include a host of inventors who had come into
					windfalls due to their own inventions. Their growth over the past thirty years has lead to several notable advancements, but also a number of mishaps that have needed
					a fair bit of attention. In recent memory, they have been responsible for the Runwich Eruption of 91 (which directly lead to the renaming of the Runwich Flows District), 
					as well as advancements in delivery thopters that have improved several industry standards.

				<h3 id="UrbanNiche"> Urban Niche </h3>
				<p> 
					Sparkwright is primarily an investment company, providing interest-free loans to smaller scientists in Blackwreth Way and beyond. They specialize in providing
					funds and resources for mechanical inventors, primarily clockwork (though they do support other individuals as well). Their core of investors provides most of the access
					to these assets, who represent the upper-middle class of the City. While their judgement is questionable, they do have extensive connections which helps them both get
					these funds and clean up any messes that might happen along the way.

					<h4> Alexus Thraw </h4>
					Thraw is an older Orc who initally founded Sparkwright and still maintains most of the control over the investments that happen here. He's good-hearted,
					but perhaps not the most intelligent when it comes to safe advancement of science. Still, his main business (brokerage) has allowed him to help a significant number of
					individuals with their work, for better or worse.
				</p>

				<h3 id="ImportantResources"> Important Resources </h3>
				<p> 
					Sparkwright has money and access to cheap metals and crafting materials (mostly glass and stone, though some alchemical supplies as well). They are expected to be repaid,
					but most inventors can get a no-interest loan if they present a prototype or design document. Sparkwright only asks for acknowledgement of their support, to further their own name.

				<h4>Sparkwright LTD. Offices</h4>
				<p>	
					Located in Blackwreth Way, the Sparkwright offices are where inventors go to secure funding, pay bills, and report mishaps. They are located on the fourth floor of a 
					larger building that maintains rentable private workshops for inventors. It tends to remain in a perpetual state of repair due to the accidents that occur from their
					tennants.
