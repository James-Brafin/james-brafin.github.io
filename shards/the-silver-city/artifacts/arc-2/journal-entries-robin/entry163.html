					Entry 163
				</p>
				<p class="italics"> 
					With the sudden change in recent events, I've had to make do with staying at my lab for now. I'm not comfortable hanging around my apartment right now,
					and I can't stay on campus. I've set up a cot and brought some food over -- I know I shouldn't be using by burners for food prep, but I just wont tell Dr. Kromer.
					On the bright side, it's given me time to focus on a few experiments and work on some of my thesis.
				</p>
				<p class="italics"> 
					While I'm here at my office hours, I'm leaving a spare key here in case I lose the one I've got for my lab. I know I shouldn't be copying it, but I don't want to
					get locked out if I lose my old one. At that point, I'd have to go back to the apartment.
				</p>
				<p class="italics"> 
					I can't shake the feeling I'm being watched. I don't know why, but something is paying attention to me. Someone? I'm not sure. I'm mostly leaving the apartment for the weird dreams.
					I barely feel like I'm sleeping. All I see is pillars of stone and shadows, and I hear things all around me. I've never seen this place before. What is happening to me?
