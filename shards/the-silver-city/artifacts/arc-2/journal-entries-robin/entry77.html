					muscle-like cells. The rEsult has been to create What is essentially meat gelatin, but it is easiEr to harvest and grow than vat-based alterNatives,
					so I'm not complaing. More Stable too. I'll have to change gears Soon due to the start of the semester, but I Will keep my fiNdings to come back to this onE
					in the future.
