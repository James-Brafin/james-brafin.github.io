					<b> Dr. Arno Kromer </b> is a halfling professor of Biomechanics at <a href="../places/Polyx-Institute.html">The Polyx Institute of Experimental Biomancy.</a> He specializes in the study of biological 
					processes and using them in modern applications, particularly those of oozes. As an NPC, Dr. Arno is played by James Bichsel.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Appearance"> Appearance </h3>
				<p> 
					Dr. Arno is a taller halfling, standing about 3.5 feet tall with shorter chocolate-brown hair that is just starting to gray. His skin is a light oak color, 
					and his eyes are slate-grey. He wears spectacles, brown slacks, a white collared shirt, and a black vest and Victorian-style suit coat.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Personality"> Personality </h3>
				<p> 
					Dr. Arno is easily excitable and a bit nervous at times. He doesn't like direct conflict and can be faint of heart, passing out when threatened with violence or serious danger.
					This can present a problem when in combat or threatened by others. He is also easily absorbed by academia, and is fascinated with both his own and his colleauges research. 
					While he doesn't have any ulterior motives with his curiosity, he can come off as nosy and bothersome to others. Fairly outgoing and friendly, he often spends time helping 
					others with their research, sometimes even at the expense of his own.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Abilities"> Abilities </h3>
				<p> 
					As a professor of Biomechancis, Dr. Arno is well versed in the subject and can readily answer questions on the subject of his own studies, 
					as well as many of his peers. As a tenured professor, he also has access to most of Polyx Institute and his name carries some weight in Lethus Polyx. While most of his
					studies are fairly benign in nature, he can offer some simple ooze-based utility items -- including a few less deadly poisons that he has stumbled onto but doesn't use himself.
				</p>

				<h3 id="History"> History </h3>
				<h4> Prior to Arc 2 </h4>
				<p> 
					Dr. Arno has been tenured at The Polyx Institute of Experimental Biomancy for nearly 15 years, ever since he was able to improve on caretaking techniques for cleaning oozes.
					In his time at the college, he has become a fairly prominent and well-respected member of the local community, and has helped to bring in an unusually large wave of students 
					to the Institute in the past few years.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Relationships"> Relationships </h3>
				<p> 
					Dr. Arno is generally distrustful of most larger Mobs and prefers to work with Mercs when he can if he needs something done. He tends to have friendly, 
					if strained, relationships with his fellow professors due to his overly-enthusiastic interest in their work, but is liked for his outgoing personality and willingness
					to help promote other's achivements. The local community tends to regard him as something of a strange individual, but enjoy him and have good rapport with 
					him and his students. His help in introducing, caring for, and troubleshooting the cleaning oozes used by many of the local establishments has also bolstered his reputation.
				</p>
				
				<h4> Dr. Orthus Robin </h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Arno sees Dr. Robin as a sort of protégé, helping them with their research and supporting their much newer academic career. Because Dr. Robin is not yet tenured, Dr. Arno has been 
					fiercely advocating for a review of their materials for several years now, with limited success due to the size of the Polyx Institute.
