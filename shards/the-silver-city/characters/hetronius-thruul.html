					<b> Dr. Hetronius Thruul </b> was a Elven Necrobiologist who studied at <a href="../places/Polyx-Institute.html">The Polyx Institute of Experimental Biomancy.</a> and was hired by Osiris, Inc. 
					to research surgery techniques before experiments with Ichor caused his change. He was a minor antagonist in Arc 1, and a major antagonist in Arc 2.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a NPC and antagonist, Dr. Thruul is played by Jacob Bichsel.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Appearance"> Appearance </h3>
				<p> 
					<h4> Prior to Arc 1 </h4>
					Hetronius Thruul was a High Elf with short brown hair and grey eyes. He was somewhat slight, and of average height.
					He typically wore turntlenecks, pants, and labwear when necessary, and carried a small rucksack with research materials and tools. 
					He frequently appeared tired and rumpled due to long work hours.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<h4> Arc 1 </h4>
					During Arc 1, Thruul appeared as a half-spider hybrid, with soft brown fur, red eyes, and four additional limbs sprouting from his back.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<h4> Arc 2 </h4>
					During Arc 2, Thruul had fully transformed into a spider-like monstrosity. The size of a large house, he was covered in fine, brown, tarantula-like fur 
					and had numerous humanoid-like eyes the size of manhole covers. His face and upper torso remained vaguely humanoid, though twisted and disfigured. 
					In this form, his fangs dripped with a fascimile of Ichor, though he didn't seem to actively produce the real substance.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Personality"> Personality </h3>
				<p> 
					Pre-transformation, Thruul was strong-willed, brash, and had little respect for ethical concerns or the harm his research might cause. 
					He had a particular fascination with Stitching to stimulate healing and regeneration. He was also paranoid and convinced that his work was being sabotaged
					by rival researchers or mobs. When working, he tended to be single-minded, often doing long hours without food or rest. He also had no qualms with researching on
					taboo materials, valuing the pursuit of knowledge over any social or legal prohibitions.
				</p>
				<p> 
					During and after his transformation, Thruul developed an obsessive need for control and revenge, as well as a healthy bloodlust. Even in his twisted form, he
					maintained a twisted desire to research, taking live human subjects to forcibly convert itno spider-like creatures to weaponize.
				</p>
				
				<hr class="mainBodyBreak">
				
				<h3 id="Abilities"> Abilities </h3>
				<p> 
					<h4> Prior to Arc 1 </h4>
					Hetronius Thruul was an intelligent and capable alchemist and healer, with a special focus on necrobiologics. 
					He developed methods of surgery healing that involved spider silks and natural stitching decomposition for improved healing and pain reduction.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Thruul also maintained seriosu connections with several mobs to source illicit materials. This network also provided him with information and extra jobs
					before his transformation.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<h4> Arc 1 </h4>
					After his inital transformation, Thruul developed spinirettes, a venomous bite, and the ability to climb on walls, as well as minor magical qualities.
					He was not fully in control of this form, which seemed to manifest itself erratically.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<h4> Arc 2 </h4>

					<h4> Prior to Arc 1 </h4>
					<b> [REDACTED] </b>
				</p>
				<p> 
					<h4> Arc 1 </h4>
					Thruul was under the employ of Elena Sharde, working to make poisons she used to assasinate politcal rivals. However, Sharde became aware of his condition and considered
					him too much of a threat to keep around. Because of this, she sent him with Frank Sterns to elimiate Sterns and remove Thruul from the picture in one single move. Thruul 
					led Stern and the rest of the group to a hidden lab where he had been working, then transformed and attacked. He was supposedly killed by the party and his lab was set on fire. No body was recovered.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<h4> Arc 2 </h4>
					Between Arc 1 and Arc 2, Thruul completed their transformation into a spider demigod-like creature. Using his newfound power, 
					he captured and converted travelers through the Undercity into spider creatures that he used as vessels to make forays into the surface. 
					These creatures would psychically torment anyone Thruul had determined was either an enemy or he deserved vengance on, 
					lure them down into the Undercity, and then also convert them. In this process, he lured down Dr. Orthos Robin, attracting the attention of [The Group] 
					and setting into motion the events of Arc 2.
