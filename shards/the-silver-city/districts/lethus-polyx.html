				<p> 
					Lethus Polyx is primarily composed of Human, Elf, and Halfling students and faculty, though a smattering of Ratfolk also live and work here. Being an educational district,
					their primary focus is on their flagship school, The Polyx Institute of Experimental Biomancy. From this establishment has grown a thriving community of resturaunts,
					small businesses, taverns, and other locales that have created a tight-knit community. While fairly few mobs circle in this area, several do recriut from the school,
					including Osiris LTD. and Thesian Developments.
